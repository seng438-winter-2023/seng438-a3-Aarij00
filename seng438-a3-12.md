# 1 Introduction

This assignment is a continuation of Assignment 2, where the implementation of black-box testing was the main goal. We now shift our focus to white-box testing in this lab. We are given the source code for the two classes (Range and DataUtilities) that we have been working with and the goal is to improve upon the test suite created in the last lab, and thus increasing overall code coverage. We used tools such as JUnit and EclEmma to help us with this assignment. The three main metrics that we will be considering are, instruction coverage, branch coverage and method coverage.

# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

Text…

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

Text…

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

Text…

# 5 A detailed report of the coverage achieved of each class and method (a screen shot from the code cover results in green and red color would suffice)

Text…

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

Text…

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.


# 8 A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed

So we mainly divided the team into two sub teams, where each sub-team worked on one method and at the end we checked each other's work, stated some improvements and improved the work likewise.

# 9 Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the lab

For most of the part, due to the guidance of our professor and our TAs the lab was manageable for us, but we still faced some learning challenges, including learning a new testing technique known as white-box testing. Moreover we had difficutlies in learning a few code coverage tools to implement in the lab. To overcome this challenege we worked as a team. Each person started learning different thing and after he/she grasped it efficiently he/she would teach that concepts top other team-members. This way we helped each other to overcome the learning obstacles.

# 10 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

This lab helped us in learning new techniques. Instructions given to us guided us properly which further helped us in completing the lab.
