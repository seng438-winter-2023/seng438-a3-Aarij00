# 1 Introduction

This assignment is a continuation of Assignment 2, where the implementation of black-box testing was the main goal. We now shift our focus to white-box testing in this lab. We are given the source code for the two classes (Range and DataUtilities) that we have been working with and the goal is to improve upon the test suite created in the last lab, and thus increasing overall code coverage. We used tools such as JUnit and EclEmma to help us with this assignment. The three main metrics that we will be considering are, instruction coverage, branch coverage and method coverage.

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

Since we had access to the source code this time, we could leverage it by tracing each method and brainstorming inputs that would execute certain parts of the code. This way we were able to come up with tests that execute the most lines of code and code branches, thus increasing our overall code coverage proportion.

## Code Coverage from A2
### Range - Instruction coverage

### Range - Branch coverage

### Range - Method coverage

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

For this lab we used EclEmma tool for code coverage. EclEmma provides detailed code coverage metrics, including instruction coverage, branch coverage, and method coverage. One useful feature of EclEmma is that it integrates nicely with the Eclipse IDE, making it easy to use for developers who work in Eclipse.
Some drawbacks of EclEmma include kimited language support since it only supports Java programs, as well as limited coverage metrics. We had to use method coverage since EclEmma doesn't support condition coverage.

Instruction coverage provides a detailed report on which lines of code were executed during testing.
It helps identify code that was not executed during testing and improve test coverage.
Branch coverage provides information on which paths through the code were executed during testing. Branch coverage can help identify branches of code that weren't executed during testing and improve test coverage.
Method coverage provides a high-level view of which methods were executed during testing. Method coverage can help developers identify methods that were not executed.

# 8 A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed

So we mainly divided the team into two sub teams, where each sub-team worked on one method and at the end we checked each other's work, stated some improvements and improved the work likewise.

# 9 Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the lab

For most of the part, due to the guidance of our professor and our TAs the lab was manageable for us, but we still faced some learning challenges, including learning a new testing technique known as white-box testing. Moreover we had difficutlies in learning a few code coverage tools to implement in the lab. To overcome this challenege we worked as a team. Each person started learning different thing and after he/she grasped it efficiently he/she would teach that concepts top other team-members. This way we helped each other to overcome the learning obstacles.

# 10 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

This lab helped us in learning new techniques. Instructions given to us guided us properly which further helped us in completing the lab.
